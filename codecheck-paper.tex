\section*{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Many areas of scientific research now use computation to either simulate
or analyse their data. These computations are increasingly complex, and
difficult to explain coherently in a paper \citep{marwick_how_2015}. To complement the
traditional route of sharing research by writing papers, there is a
growing trend/demand to share the underlying artifacts, notably code and
datasets, so that others can inspect, reproduce or expand that work
(Figure 1). Some of the earliest proponents were Buckheit and Donoho \cite{buckheit_wavelab_1995} who coined what has been called 
\emph{Claerbout's claim} (extending on \citet{claerbout_electronic_1992}):
\emph{"An article about computational science in a scientific publication 
is \text{not} the scholarship itself, it is merely \textbf{advertising} of
the scholarship. The actual scholarship is the complete software development
environment and the complete set of instructions which generated the 
figures."}
%  Donoho (2010) has another paraphrasing of the same quote, which might work better:
% "an article about computational result is advertising, not scholarship. The actual scholarship is the full software environment, code and data, that produced the result."

So, assuming that researchers begin to share more artifacts, how might
they be examined to test that they do what they claim? For example,
most scientific journals now require a data sharing statement that
outlines what data the authors have (or will) share. The
implementation status of this varies considerably according to the
journal. At one of the spectrum, there are specialist journals that
have been created to accept ``data papers'' (e.g.~\href{}{\emph{Scientific
  Data}}, 
\href{https://essd.copernicus.org/}{\emph{Earth System Science Data}}, 
\href{https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/20496060}{\emph{Geoscience Data Journal}},
\href{https://bdj.pensoft.net/}{\emph{Biodiversity Data Journal}},
\href{https://openpsychologydata.metajnl.com/}{\emph{Journal of Open Psychology Data}},
\href{https://odjar.org/}{\emph{Open Data Journal for Agricultural Research}},
\href{https://openhealthdata.metajnl.com}{\emph{Journal of Open Health Data}}).
These journals have established rigorous procedures by which
the data is validated according to standards in each field. At the
other end of the spectrum, we still witness today the infamous
statement ``Data available upon reasonable request'' whereby authors,
while possible well-intentioned at the time of writing the article,
often cannot provide the data when readers ask for
it.  (ANDREW H: any references to sum up poor/evolving state of data
sharing; Vines et al 2014).

Given that there are no clear standards yet for sharing data, what hope
might there be for sharing computer programs? Our anectodal experiences
on this matter suggest that often a variety of reasons are given for why
their code cannot be shared, e.g.~``there is no documentation / I do not
want to maintain it / I do not want to give away my code to my
competitors''. Our view, rooted in open science princples, is that
wherever possible sharing code is good for the community, as outlined
ten years ago \cite{Barnes2010-iv}. Having the code freely available, and
suitably archived, provides a valuable resource for others to learn
from, even when it doesn't run or if there is no documentation. However,
with a little effort, we believe that if someone independent can run/execute
the code, this is worth documenting as early as possible. With this in
mind, we have developed a set of PRINCIPLES and an example workflow that
provides what he hope is a pragmatic way of checking that code works. We
call this system CODECHECK as outlined next.

  half of the diagram shows the diverse range of materials used
  internally within a laboratory.  These materials are often then
  condensed into a paper for sharing with the outside world via the
  research paper, a static PDF document.  Working backwards from the
  PDF to the underlying materials is impossible. This probihibits reuse
  and is not only non-transparent for a specific paper, but also 
  ineffective for science as a whole. By sharing the
  materials on the left, others outside the lab are able to reproduce
  or build on this work.}

\end{figure}

\section*{What is a CODECHECK?}\label{what-is-a-codecheck}

CODECHECK is best demonstrated by way of our example workflow, and later
we expand on the underlying principles. The workflow involves three
groups of people: (1) the AUTHOR of a paper providing the code to be checked, (2)
the PUBLISHER of a journal intereseted in publishing the paper by the
AUTHOR and (3) the CODECHECKER who checks that the AUTHOR's code works.
The workflow that we have refined is documented in Figure 2.

\textbf{Step 1:} the AUTHOR submit their manuscript along with code and data to
the PUBLISHER. The code and data need not be openly available at this point.
However, in many cases the code and data may be published on a code hosting platform,
such as GitHub/Lab.

\textbf{Step 2:} the publisher finds a CODECHECKER to check the code. This is
analogous to the publisher finding one or more reviewers to evaluating
the paper. However, a cruical difference is that we suggest the CODECHECKER
and the author can talk freely to each other directly (see next).

\textbf{Step 3:} the CODECHECKER runs the code, based on instructions provided by
the author, and checks if some/all of the results from the paper can be
reproduced. (See later for exact nature of ``reproduced''). If there are
any problems running the code, the CODECHECKER asks the author for help
to resolve the problems. The CODECHECKER then tries to run the code
again. This process iterates until either the CODECHECKER is successful,
or the CODECHECKER concludes the code does not work (\emph{what do in this
case}). As part of this process, the CODECHECKER could work entirely
locally on their own compute resource, or in the cloud, e.g.~using the open
MyBinder infrastructure \cite{jupyter_binder_2018}. Using such cloud-based 
infrastructure allows for the CODECHECKER and author to collaboratively improve
the code and enforces a much more complete definition of the computing environment,
but, unless infrastructure is provided by, e.g., by the publisher, requires code
and data to be published openly online.

\textbf{Step 4:} the CODECHECKER writes a certificate stating how the code was
run and includes a copy of outputs (figures, tables) that were
independently generated. The certificate may include further recommendations to
the author how to improve the material.

\textbf{Step 5:} the certificate as well as auxiliary files created during the check,
e.g., a specifiction of a computing environment, helper scripts, and the code and data,
if available under open licenses, get deposited in an open archive (currently Zenodo);
the certificate is given to the PUBLISHER.

\textbf{Step 6:} the PUBLISHER can then use the certificate as part of their
supplementary records for a paper or provide it to scientific reviewers; the
PUBLISHER also gives credit to the CODECHECKER for their work by depositing the
activity appropriately in scholarly publication databases, such as ORCID.
The PULISHER also ensures proper publication metadata, e.g., links from the 
certificate repository to the published paper or the original code repository.

\subsection*{Variations}\label{variations}

DANIEL: COULD YOU DO THIS SECTION ON DIMENSIONS?
This example workflow leaves sufficient room for different
implementations of this process. There are several aspects that can be
considered:

\subsubsection*{When to do a codecheck}\label{when-to-do-a-codecheck}

preprint (no publisher available), pre-condition for peer review, during
peer review, after acceptance. Each of these have their own pros/cons.

\subsubsection*{Who does the codecheck}\label{who-does-the-codecheck}

in house staff, pool of ECRs, volunteeres, for inhouse staff, credit not
an issue.

\subsubsection*{Who knows who?}\label{who-knows-who}

single blind, double blind, private/public communication between author
and codechecker, collaborative. (This might need finessing with
principle 2 below).

\section*{Core principles}\label{core-principles}

The workflow and variations just outlined below reflect our current
views on how a codecheck should be performed. They are not set in
stone, but we do believe the following core principles underpin our
CODECHECK:

\textbf{1. Codecheckers record but don't investigate or fix.} The
codechecker follows the instructions provided by the author in running
the code. If any steps are unclear, or if code does not run correctly,
the codechecker records this fact, and then communicates this
information to the author. We believe that the job of the codechecker is
not to fix all these problems, but simply to report them, and await a
fix from the author.

\textbf{2. Communication between humans is key.} Some code may just work
without any interaction (e.g.~Manuel's certificate TODO add cert number); 
however, more often
there are hidden dependencies that need to be found, or revised software
installations. Allowing the codechecker and human to communicate
directly and openly with each other should make this process as
constructive as possible. We feel that routing this conversation
(possibly anonymously) through a publisher would slow things down and
reduce the chances for community building as well as the lessons learned
for both author and codecheckers.

\textbf{3. Credit is given to codecheckers.} The value of contributing a
CODECHECK is comparable to providing a scientific peer review. Indiviual
variations aside, it may also require a similar amount of time. Therefore,
the codechecker's activity should be publicly recorded and mentioned in the
published paper.
The public record can be realised by publishing the certificate in a 
citable form (i.e., with a DOI; this is done within the community codecheck
process), by listing codecheckers on the journal's website or, ideally, by
publishing the checks alongside peer review activities in public databases,
such as ORCID \footnote{\href{https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006971333-Peer-Review}{https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006971333-Peer-Review}}
or Publons.

\textbf{4. Workflows must be auditable.} This requires that the codechecker 
has at least enough material to validate the workflow outputs submitted by 
the authors. Tode could be executed at least once without critical errors or
warnings using the provided instructions, and, therefore, all code and data 
was given and could be investigated more deeply or extended in the future.
Ideally, this is a "one~click" step, but achieving this requires particular 
skills. It is also hard to create a sufficient level of documentation for 
third parties. That is why the possibility to communicate is more important
than perfected workflows, and why a CODECHECK is not automated.
A codechecker does \emph{not} conduct a code review.
% more content from the website, may fit better elsewhere:
% The CODECHECK is not automated on purpose: automation may (a) lead to people gaming the system, (b) hide details that eventually decrease level of certainty that a codechecker has in their assessment, and (c) reduce the understandability of instructions in the long term, which is more important than short term ease of use (see Principle 2).

\textbf{5. Open by default.}  By default, unless there are strong
reasons to the contrary (e.g., clinically-sensitive data), all code and
data, both from author and codechecker, will be made freely available, i.e., 
under open licenses, when the certificate is published. The code and data 
publication should follow community good practices.

\section*{Register}\label{register}

We have a curated list of 15 certificates available at
\url{https://codecheck.org.uk/register}. These are a mixture of
reproductions of papers for a variety of reasons (do we name them all?)
from interesting historical papers, to papers codechecked as part of
peer review, or because of public interest (covid). several covid models
have been done during the time of peer review of these papers, under our
initative rather than requested from journal, but certificate have then
been acknowledged/cited in the paper (LANCET / LSHTM).
Table~\ref{tab:register} lists the certificates completed to date,
along with citations to the original papers.

The bulk of the certificates fall into three themes: (1) `classic'
papers from computational neuroscience (2) Covid modelling preprints, and
(3) GIScience.  
The first theme was the initial set of papers used to explore the concept
of CODECHECK. The idea was to take very well known articles from a specific
domain, in this case the work area of co-author S.~Eglen, possibly as as a
conversation starter for potential collaborating journals.
The second theme is rather opportunistic. As the COVID-19 pandemic swept
over the whole Earth, we hoped to contribute to science's answer to the
unknown virus. The checks were solicited through community interaction.
The third theme represents co-author D.~N\"ust's work area.
Independent of CODECHECK, the \emph{Reproducible AGILE} Initiative \cite{reproducible_agile}
established a process for reproducing workflows at the AGILE conference
series. % TODO add reference to MUNIN talk
While using slightly different terms and infrastructue, e.g., `reproducibility
reports' are published on OSF, instead of certificates on Zenodo, the 
reproducibility reviews adhere to the codecheck principles.
Furthermore, two checks were completed as part of a peer review for a
GIScience journal.

Out of these areas, we would like to briefly highlight three examples here.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Gigascience -- our first paper. Only visualisation, not machine
  learning (which would have taken sseveral days of compute time).
\item
  report 9 -- covid model of UK lockdown model -- unlike many claims
  in the popular media at the time, the model was reproducible
  [NOORDEN news piece]. 
\item
  Manuel's certificate -- approached us as he requested a certificate
  as paper was entering peer review.

\subsection*{Annotated certificate}\label{annotated-certificate}

At the completion of each CODECHECK, a certificate is written that
states which figures and tables from the original article could be
reproduced by the CODECHECKER.  This certificate is made freely
available so that all readers of the article can see which elements
have been reproduced.  The certificate also includes links to the code
and data used by the codechecker, allowing others to build on the
work.  The format of the certificates has evolved slightly during the
project, as we have learnt to automate different aspects of the
certification.  

To demonstrate the typical contents of a certificate, in
Figure~\ref{fig:cert} we have annotated the first four (out of ten)
pages of the certificate 2020-012 \cite{cert-2020-012}.  The reference
article \cite{Unwin2020} describes the modelling COVID-19 across the
USA.
%% TODO - has this been published yet?.  No, not yet... in review...
Figure~\ref{fig:cert}A shows the certificate number, and its DOI,
which points to the certificate as archived on Zenodo.  Our logo is
attached to the certificate to denote successful reproduction.
Figure~\ref{fig:cert}B provides the key metadata about the check --
which paper was checked, and who/when it was checked.  Materials
relating to the codecheck are freely available via the Repository
link.  Figure~\ref{fig:cert}C is a summary of how the codecheck was
performed, and any interesting findings.

Figure~\ref{fig:cert}D (page 2 of the certificate) shows a table that
lists the outputs that were generated from the codecheck (this is
termed the MANIFEST.)  For each output, there is a comment stating
which figure/table it should be compared to in the original paper,
along with the size of the file.  On page 3 of the certificate,
Figure~\ref{fig:cert}E shows some more detailed notes from the
codechecker, in this case indicating what steps were needed to
initialize the environment and run the code.  This particular example
was quite long, taking about 17 hours to run.  Finally, on page 4 of
the certificate, we see the first output that was generated by the
codecheck (Figure~\ref{fig:cert}F).  In this case, the figure matches
figure 4 of REF.  Subsequent pages of the certificate show other
outputs (not shown here).

  \label{fig:cert}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Tools and resources}\label{tools}

To run the system, we rely on freely available infrastructure, more 
specifically GitHub and Zenodo.

The \texttt{codecheckers} GitHub organisation\footnote{
\url{https://github.com/codecheckers}} contains projects managing the
project website, the community of codecheckers, community discussions,
forks of codechecked code repositories, and the main register for
managing the collection of checks. Both the website\footnote{
\url{https://codecheck.org.uk/}} and the register
\footnote{\url{https://codecheck.org.uk/register}} are hosted as GitHub
pages. The register is effectively a single table in CSV format that
connects the certificate identifier with the repository associated with
a specific conducted codecheck. Each of these repositories, which 
currently can be hosted on GitHub or Open Science Framework (OSF), 
contains the CODECHECK metadata file \texttt{codecheck.yml}. The register
further contains a column for the type of check, e.g., community, journal,
or conference, and the respective GitHub issue where communications and 
assignments around a specific check are organised. No information is 
duplicated between the register and the metadata files. When a new
certificate is entered into the register, an automated process using 
continuous integration infrastructure of GitHub, GitHub Actions, retrieves
the metadata files and builds different representations of the register
for viewing (HTML) or integration with other services (CSV, JSON).

Zenodo is an open repository for scientific data and documents. It
mints DOIs for deposits and ensures long-term availability of all digital
artefacts related to the project. These include the community 
certificates as well as the register, which is regularly archived to 
Zenodo \cite{codecheck_register} (including all file formats).

A custom R package, \texttt{codecheck}\footnote{
\url{https://github.com/codecheckers/codecheck}} helps with the generation
of certificates and depositing certificates and reated files on Zenodo 
using the R package \texttt{zen4R} \cite{zen4r}.
Codecheckers may choose to not use the package and rely on their own tools
for creating the certificate. This is a deliberate flexibility to
accomodate both different skill sets and unforseen technical advances or
challenges.

These tools and resources demonstrate that a CODECHECK process can be
managed without infrastructure costs on freely available platforms.
The scripted and automated parts should also ensure that more checks can
be conducted in the future.
The remaining costs are the project's domain, which is negligible, and
the human resources for managing the project and processes, which are
considerable and currently soley based on, partly grant-based, public funding.
Naturally, similar set-ups are possible, such as using GitLab/GitLab.com 
and the GitLab CI instead of GitHub and GitHub Actions, or using a different 
data repository for depositing certificates and data.

\section*{Related work}\label{related-work}

TO BE CONTINUED.

All the related projectsfrom A-Z\ldots{} e.g.~CASCAID, Rescience,
modeldb, o2r. Community iniatives like reprohack along similar lines of
checking code. \url{https://reprohack.github.io/reprohack-hq/}

DELIBERATEY NOT COMPREHENSIVE HERE.

\section*{Limitations}\label{limitations}

\textbf{Handling failure}: we have no established process for this, as
so far all our codechecks succeeded. Open question remains as what to do
in this case -- should we publicly report that the code would not run.

\textbf{Compute time}: for those papers that take significant compute
time (think days, not minutes), who will pay for the compute time?

\textbf{Software}: authors can currently provide code that requires
propieratiry software. Given the prevalence of software like MATLAB,
this seems like a pragmatic choice, but then (a) we can't rely on open
infrastructure like mybinder, (b) codechecker must have that software.

\textbf{Can't someone cheat?} yes. we don't check it is correct code,
just simply that it runs. Very low bar. But by having the code open,
interested parties can then examine the code, and knowing that the code
will be open we hope will be an incentive for authors to share.

\textbf{Who's got time for more peer review?} Agree, but ECRS might be
attracted to working with groups (recall it is not anonymous)

\textbf{Who finds the codechecker?} Good point! The journal. Community
however think this is an important issue, and are volunteering.

\textbf{Checking multiple times?}  If you check a preprint before peer
review, it might need checking again as it is modified during peer
review.  Unavoidable, and as happened to us (2020-012 has been
revised).  But checking the manuscript the second time is likely to be
much less work than the first time.

As a principle, we do not require results to be exactly the same for a
codecheck to pass, simply that the code runs and generates the output
files that the author claims. Stochastic simulations mean that often
we cannot get exactly the same, or even different versions of
libraries.  (Cite freesurfer example \cite{Gronenschild2012-pp} that
generates different outputs on different operating systems).

\begin{itemize}
\item modelDB principle: minimum of one figure should be reproducibe.
  Example certificate 2020-016 (I think) which had only a small subset
  of the possible figures. Still useful and worth sharing.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Future work and conclusions}\label{future-work-and-conclusions}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  possibility to allow CI for open papers such that for ``nearly free''
  we can find out when softwave breaks, and if provenance tools are
  used, when.
\item
  How to embed this in journals.
\item
  When is CODECHECK redundant? will it become part of regular peer
  review? or, if ayuthors become more skillful, then everything becomes
  automated, and no need for codecheck. CODECHECK disappearing is then a
  measure of success.
\end{itemize}

Or will it always be adjunct to peer review, and needed?

working within the trad system of publishers to help push the
conversation along.

\section*{What is CODE CHECK?}\label{what-is-code-check}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Principles}: \url{https://codecheck.org.uk/}
\item
  relation to ``proper'' citation of data and software, and depositing
  of data and software in suitable repos \emph{besides} the bundle for
  CODE CHECK: do it, only provide the concrete analysis script for the
  check
\item
  \textbf{Why is it useful?}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    reduce the barrier to evaluating non-text parts of research
  \item
    acknowledges different skill sets and existing high load on
    reviewers
  \item
    CC breaks problem that publishers staff expertise today is not
    likely to suffice
  \item
    engaging ECRs is a perfet fit (they are up-to-date in methods, are
    introduced to peer review)
  \item
    relation to research compendia? point it out for authors unsure
    about how to structure their workflow
  \item
    CrossRef and Publons and ORCID have features around reviews
  \item
    shifting burden from reviewer to author (but not too much)
  \item
    What issues with (open) peer review does CODECHECK address?
  \end{itemize}
\item
  keynote \url{https://doi.org/10.7557/5.4963}: in discussion, the
  speaker mentioned value of peer review for ``baseline reassurance'',
  i.e.~a paper has at least been checked by someone with an
  understanding, to increase trust especially if looking at papers from
  other disciplines
\item
  \textbf{report} must fulfil some requirements to make clear what is
  really checked and not mislead - readers will have very different
  understandings of a green checkmark!
\item
  reproducibility is hard
  \url{https://twitter.com/annakrystalli/status/1144176149859377152?ref_src=twsrc\%5Etfw}
  \textgreater{} code check gives at least some benefits
\item
  what are the requirements / level or reproducibility required or
  checked?

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \href{https://stodden.net/icerm_report.pdf}{Stodden et al., 2013}:
    five-level hierarchy of research - reviewable, replicable,
    confirmable, auditable, and open or reproducible
  \item
    \href{https://figshare.com/articles/Showing_your_working_A_guide_to_reproducible_neuroimaging_analyses/4244996/2}{Whitaker
    2017}: reproducible, generalisable, replicability, robustnes
  \end{itemize}
\item
  can authors retract their code/data once a CODECHECK has started? In
  the eLife prepreint review, there seems no ``way back'', see
  \url{https://twitter.com/ceptional/status/1271528976763121664?s=09}

\section*{CODE CHECK implementation concepts}\label{code-check-implementation-concepts}

\begin{itemize}

  \emph{dimensions} along which a check can vary
\item
  independent/pre-submission (Peer\_Coding) by author + colleagues

  \item
    \ldots{}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  flexible level of detail? a check can be enhanced to (potentially
  semi-automatically) check for good practices

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    ``A group of us in the ({\textbf{???}}) Software Citation
    Implementation Working Group produced a''Software Citation Checklist
    for Authors" \url{https://t.co/4Noe66FsoX} providing guidelines on
    how to cite software and describing why it is important and what
    software should be cited" via
    \url{https://twitter.com/alegonbel/status/1207664922932453376?s=09})
  \end{itemize}
\item
  focus on ECR as codecheckers

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    ECR are the one's breaking new ground in schol comm, cf.~the
    percentages of career stages submitting registered reports on slide
    20 \textgreater{} \url{https://osf.io/2vjus/}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Annotated Examples}\label{annotated-examples}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{the default implementation}
\item
  critically discuss our/the default implementation vs.~the principles
\item
  HPC example
\item
  if we see the corpus of examles as a scientific dataset, it should be
  published in a citable way (maybe even submit to a data journal)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Open problems}\label{open-problems}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Do publishers need to build up data science experts who can conduct
  checks?
\item
  Is an integration of software/data citation checks
  benefitial/realistic?
\item
  Bot-support and tools (linter, report authoring with R Markdown)
\item
  How can open platforms be used to enable a review in private
  (cf.~\url{https://www.cambridge.org/core/blog/2019/08/19/how-to-make-the-data-and-code-for-your-manuscript-available-to-peer-reviewers-before-making-it-public/}),
  if that is desired
\item
  Does nudging towards better practices work (highlight the successes)
  or is any check with opt-in doomed to fail?
\item
  Do we need more than one codechecker? Is there a similar diversity as
  in a peer review where more opinions are needed?
\item
  can CODECHECK work for preprints? how? is a re-check required?
\item
  Risk: is the hurdle too low? are ``levels'' of checks are solution to
  increase transparency of check's level of detail
\item
  CODECHECK in the context of innovations and disruptions in scientific
  publishing

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \url{https://doi.org/10.1042/ETLS20180172}
  \item
    \url{https://doi.org/10.3390/publications7020034}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Should every code be checkd, or should the labour be capped by only
  checking ``important'' works or at important stages; if yes, isn't
  peer review such a stage?
\item
  see \url{https://github.com/codecheckers/discussion}
\item
  Can we establish code checks as a type of review within the schol comm
  metadata (or should we?) \textgreater{} we should not, put them on the
  same level as reviews!
\item
  How can we turn a CODECHECK into a positive experience?

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    cf.~kindness in peer review in
    \url{https://www.mdpi.com/2304-6775/8/2/26}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  How can we allow reactions to checks? (commenting on reports)
\item
  Will bitwise reproducibility become easier than what a CODECHECK does?
  triggered by
  \url{https://twitter.com/khinsen/status/1242842759733665799?s=09})
\item
  If a report is not published for failures: Isn't there a bias for the
  codechecker to have a ``successful'' reproduction because then a
  report is published?
\end{itemize}
