\section*{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Many areas of scientific research now use computation to either simulate
or analyse their data. These computations are increasingly complex, and
difficult to explain coherently in a paper \citep{marwick_how_2015}.
To complement the traditional route of sharing research by writing papers,
there is a growing trend/demand to share the underlying artifacts, notably 
code and datasets, so that others can inspect, reproduce or expand that work
(see Figure~\ref{fig:inverse}).
Some of the earliest proponents were Buckheit and Donoho
\cite{buckheit_wavelab_1995} who coined what has been called 
\emph{Claerbout's claim} (extending on \citet{claerbout_electronic_1992}):
\emph{"An article about computational science in a scientific publication 
is \text{not} the scholarship itself, it is merely \textbf{advertising} of
the scholarship. The actual scholarship is the complete software development
environment and the complete set of instructions which generated the 
figures."}
%  Donoho (2010) has another paraphrasing of the same quote, which might work better:
% "an article about computational result is advertising, not scholarship. The actual scholarship is the full software environment, code and data, that produced the result."

So, assuming that researchers begin to share more artifacts, how might
they be examined to test that they do what they claim? For example,
most scientific journals now require a data sharing statement that
outlines what data the authors have (or will) share.
The implementation status of this varies considerably according to the
journal. At one of the spectrum, there are specialist journals that
have been created to accept ``data papers''
(e.g.~\href{https://www.nature.com/sdata/}{\emph{Scientific~Data}}, 
\href{https://essd.copernicus.org/}{\emph{Earth System Science Data}}, 
\href{https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/20496060}{\emph{Geoscience Data Journal}},
\href{https://bdj.pensoft.net/}{\emph{Biodiversity Data Journal}},
\href{https://openpsychologydata.metajnl.com/}{\emph{Journal of Open Psychology Data}},
\href{https://odjar.org/}{\emph{Open Data Journal for Agricultural Research}},
\href{https://openhealthdata.metajnl.com}{\emph{Journal of Open Health Data}}).
These journals have established rigorous procedures by which
the data is validated according to standards in each field. At the
other end of the spectrum, we still witness today the infamous
statement ``Data available upon reasonable request'' whereby authors,
while possible well-intentioned at the time of writing the article,
often cannot provide the data when readers ask for
it.  (ANDREW H: any references to sum up poor/evolving state of data
sharing; Vines et al 2014).

Given that there are no clear standards yet for sharing data, what hope
might there be for sharing computer programs? While both data and software
together are required to validate outcomes of a computational analysis,
the do differ in the respect that the former can be seen as static/inert,
while the latter requires an environment and interaction. This makes 
software harder to share.
Our anectodal experiences
on this matter suggest that often a variety of reasons are given for why
code cannot be shared, e.g.~``there is no documentation / I do not
want to maintain it / I do not want to give away my code to my
competitors''. Our view, rooted in Open Science princples, is that
wherever possible sharing code is good for the community, as outlined
ten years ago \cite{Barnes2010-iv}. Having the code freely available, and
suitably archived, provides a valuable resource for others to learn
from, even when it doesn't run or if there is no documentation. However,
with a little effort, we believe that if someone independent can run/execute
the code, this is worth documenting as early as possible and that the barrier
to evaluating non-text parts of research can be greatly reduced with a 
focused approach.
Just like peer review can provide a ``baseline reasurance'', i.e., a paper
has at least ben checked by someone with an understanding of the topic
\cite{fyfe_mission_2019}, we think the same baseline should be provided
regarding the workflow underlying a paper.
With this in mind, we have developed a set of PRINCIPLES and an example 
workflow that provides what he hope is a pragmatic way of checking that 
code works.

The main contribution of this work is a thorough description of a process
and its variations to integrate a much needed evaluation of the 
computational reproducibility \cite{barba_terminologies_2018} into peer
review, and a demonstration of its feasibility by means of over 20
reproductions across different scientific disciplines.
We call this system CODECHECK as outlined next.

  half of the diagram shows the diverse range of materials used
  internally within a laboratory.  These materials are often then
  condensed into a paper for sharing with the outside world via the
  research paper, a static PDF document.  Working backwards from the
  PDF to the underlying materials is impossible. This probihibits reuse
  and is not only non-transparent for a specific paper, but also 
  ineffective for science as a whole. By sharing the
  materials on the left, others outside the lab are able to reproduce
  or build on this work.}

\section*{What is a CODECHECK?}\label{what-is-a-codecheck}

\subsection*{Workflow and people}\label{workflow-people}

CODECHECK is best demonstrated by way of our example workflow, and later
we expand on the underlying principles. The workflow involves three
groups of people: (1) the AUTHOR of a paper providing the code to be checked, (2)
the PUBLISHER of a journal intereseted in publishing the paper by the
AUTHOR and (3) the CODECHECKER who checks that the AUTHOR's code works.
The workflow that we have refined is documented in Figure~\ref{fig:workflow}.

% TODO: how is a CODECHECK different from a "specialist reviewer" ? Is it because it is not special, but regular?

  \caption{The CODECHECK example process implementation. Codechecker act as a detectives:
  The investigate and record, but do not fix issues.}
  \label{fig:worfklow}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Step 1:} the AUTHOR submit their manuscript along with code and data to
the PUBLISHER. The code and data need not be openly available at this point.
However, in many cases the code and data may be published on a code hosting platform,
such as GitHub or GitLab. Ideally, the AUTHOR is expecting the CODECHECK and
prepares for it, e.g., by asking a colleague to briefly attempt a reproduction
of the submitted workflow.

\textbf{Step 2:} the publisher finds a CODECHECKER to check the code. This is
analogous to the publisher finding one or more reviewers to evaluating
the paper. However, a cruical difference is that we suggest the CODECHECKER
and the author can talk freely to each other directly (see next).

\textbf{Step 3:} the CODECHECKER runs the code, based on instructions provided by
the author, and checks if some/all of the results from the paper can be
reproduced. (See later for exact nature of ``reproduced''). If there are
any problems running the code, the CODECHECKER asks the author for help
to resolve the problems. The burden to provide reproducible material lies with
the author.
The CODECHECKER then tries to run the code again.
This process iterates until either the CODECHECKER is successful,
or the CODECHECKER concludes the code does not work (\emph{what do in this
case}). As part of this process, the CODECHECKER could work entirely
locally on their own compute resource, or in the cloud, e.g.~using the open
MyBinder infrastructure \cite{jupyter_binder_2018} or alternatives, some of which
are more tailored for scientific publications while others offer commercial
options to, e.g., publishers \cite{}.
Using such cloud-based 
infrastructure allows for the CODECHECKER and author to collaboratively improve
the code and enforces a much more complete definition of the computing environment,
but, unless infrastructure is provided by, e.g., by the publisher, requires code
and data to be published openly online.
Note that the taks of the CODECHECKER is to check the ``mechanics'' of the
workflow, not to evaluate its correctness. 
Stodden et~al. \cite{stodden_setting_2013} destinguish between verification and
validation in the context of Mathematics, and in the same vein a CODECHECK
ensures a verification\footnote{Note this is a different use as the \emph{Verification Reports} article type in the journal \emph{Cortex}
\cite{chambers_verification_2020}},
i.e., checking that the code correctly produces the 
output it claims to create, but not a validation, i.e., does the code implement
the right algorithm to solve the problem that is researched, 
of the computational results.

\textbf{Step 4:} the CODECHECKER writes a certificate stating how the code was
run and includes a copy of outputs (figures, tables) that were
independently generated. The certificate may include further recommendations to
the author how to improve the material.
The plain text in the certificate is the most flexible and feasible way to 
make clear what was really checked. Readers will have very different 
understandings of what a ``green'' checkmark (cf. Step~5) means.

\textbf{Step 5:} the certificate as well as auxiliary files created during the check,
e.g., a specifiction of a computing environment, helper scripts, and the code and data,
if available under open licenses, get deposited in an open archive (currently Zenodo);
the certificate is given to the PUBLISHER.

\textbf{Step 6:} the PUBLISHER can then use the certificate as part of their
supplementary records for a paper or provide it to scientific reviewers; the
PUBLISHER also gives credit to the CODECHECKER for their work by depositing the
activity appropriately in scholarly publication databases, such as ORCID.
The PULISHER also ensures proper publication metadata, e.g., links from the 
certificate repository to the published paper or the original code repository.
A badge or other visual aid may be applied to highlight the fact of a completed
CODECHECK and provide a incentive and reward for the, today often considered
``additional'' efforts of providing readily computationally reproducible workflows,
despite the simplification into a binary value and the possible confusion of
the meaning, especially across disciplines and methods.

\subsection*{Variations}\label{variations}

\subsubsection*{Dimensions of CODECHECK workflows}\label{dimensions-of-workflows}

The example workflow leaves room for different
implementations of this process. To elaborate on these options, we consider
the following dimensions in a space of possible CODECHECK workflows, as shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:dimensions}, to represent relevant aspects for the involved
stakeholders. These aspects touch on timing, responsibilities, and 
transparency and will be discussed in the following sections.
Each of these have their own pros and cons and can for the most part be
freely combined.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{When to do a CODECHECK and with what power}
\label{when-to-do-a-codecheck}

The time for a CODECHECK greatly depends on the intentions and the ascribed
importance. The earlier a CODECHECK happens in the process, the more the
results can play a role in the most important decision in scholarly 
communication: is a paper published, sent back for revisions, or rejected.
The later in a review process the check happens, the less challenging is it
to allow a bidirectional communication between author and codechecker, e.g.,
because the author might already be notified of the acceptance and may more
freely share materials online.
Even earlier checks, i.e., a CODECHECK of a preprint, may even help to 
improve the workflow itself even before a publisher is involved. The 
possibility for codechecking papers could be part of a preprint server's
policy, or simply be initiated by interested readers and community members.
% TODO add a sentence about the possible effect of just asking for
% code/data early on in the submission process, see https://twitter.com/tsuyomiyakawa/status/1230672758163402752?s=09)

A pre-review CODECHECK allows editors to use it as a filter to only send 
a submission out to peer review if it passes the check. A less strict
pre-review check would simply be included in the submission package provided
to the reviewers, so they can include the CODECHECK's results in their 
evaluation of the work.
A CODECHECK may also be conducted in parallel to the scientific review. This
puts less burden on the turnaround time for the check yet only makes the 
outcomes available for the final consideration of the handling editor.
The check could also be tasked on demand, e.g., only if one of the reviewers
suggests/requests one because previous screenings might not have caught the 
fact that a computational workflow is part of the submission. However, 
soliciting such a "specialist review" is much more undesirable than having
a regular CODECHECK, without any special treatment for some submissions.
A CODECHECK could then be awared equal weight as the other reviews.
A post acceptance CODECHECK puts the least requirements on the author and may
simply lead to an award of excellence on top of the acceptance of the
submission. This is the least strict solution while still properly 
acknowleding the check results, because the CODECHECK is to be completed 
before the publication of the final paper.
The GIScience group of checks (see \nameref{register}) falls into this
category: the AGILE conference highlights articles where the reproducibility
was successfully reviewed with a badge on the volume and article landing
pages.

Finally, a CODECHECK may also be conducted after publication, though it
would required to update the article later with a note to reference the check,
otherwise readers would presumably not be aware of it. While this has the
least impact on the current publishing practices, it also has the smallest
effect and does not acknowledge the importance of reproducible workflows for
ensuring good scientific practice.

\subsubsection*{Who does the CODECHECK?}\label{who-does-the-codecheck}

The options for the person who can conduct a CODECHECK require a not quite
simple matching of a combination of skills and availability. Ideally, the
codechecker has a matching code \emph{and} domain expertise, for example to
check a workflow based on Python code analysing MRT brain imagery. However,
a well-documented workflow should be executable by any person with a basic
understanding of computers. Naturally, the more prerequisite knowledge the
codechecker has, the less time is spend to understand the goals and 
the mechanics of an analysis. From our experiences, the priority should be
given to matching technical expertise first, as the a lack of knowledge in
setting  up a computing environment with a particular language or tool is 
much more discouraging and the assessment of the outcome, e.g., comparing
created figures with the original, is largely possible without 
understanding.
The time and expertise alloted to the check
are the main drivers for the depth of checking, though in general, we 
expect a CODECHECK not to evaluate performance, e.g., does a racing car
have the best apex speed, but to assess operation free of failure, i.e., 
is it a car with 4 wheels and at least one door, and does it move forwards
when accelerating. This depth can be seen independent from the power of
the check (see above), as long as it is communicated clearly to all
stakeholders, most importantly authors and readers.

The concrete people to provide these expertises can range from researchers,
possibly drawn from the regular pool of volunteer reviewers or from a 
special group, to editorial staff of a publisher. If the regular reviewers
are relied upon, the editor's task to find suitable ones becomes more
tedious; extra information such as software familiarity would have to be
modelled in review platforms. Keeping diverse specialists as staff to
realise a codechking process is unlikely to be feasible, especially for 
small or independent publishers.

We consider a single codechecker to be enough, unlike peer review where
multiple referees are common. Because of the technical focus, the 
determination if the concrete outputs of author and codechecker, who can
collaborate to solve any issues, should be a very factual process and not
require much debate or opinion. Depending on the power of the CODECHECK
(see \ref{when-to-do-a-codecheck}), a mediator, e.g., the editor, or a
second opinion might be warranted in rare cases.

We see a great opportunity to especially involve early-career researchers
(ECRs) as codecheckers. They arguably have a high interest in learning
about the latest tools and technologies as they are building up their own
expertise and specialisation. The possibility to gain insights into latest
science for ECRs and at the same time increase the appreciation of
reproduction efforts is a sweet spot that CODECHECK shares
with \emph{ReScience X}, a journal devoted to reproduction and replication 
experiments \cite{roesch_new_2020}.
In fact, ECRs are often much more familiar with latest technology and are 
likely to be early adoptors as creators, i.e., be authors of CODECHECK-ready manuscripts, too\footnote{Cf. the 77\% of 141 registered reports who were 
submitted to leading Neuroscience journals by ECRs
\cite{chambers_registered_2019}.}
They are also introduced to peer review and 
may transition into the role of scientific reviewer over time.
Not to solve the general problems of peer review, which is largely an
unsupervised process, i.e., rarely are reviewers taught how to do it, but
a junior codechecker may be supported by a senior codechecker, too.
We see a high potential in setting up the new processes for CODECHECKING with
a clear committment on openness and transparency, independent of the
respective current peer review process (see \nameref{who-knows-who}).

Publisher staff represents the most controlled yet also not quickly scalable
option. Hiring the required technical and or domain expertise puts a financial
burden on the publisher, of course, but such a committment also shows the 
value given to publishing reproducibility and would positively impact the 
submission experience, because of more controllability, and external 
perception of the journal or conference. A staff codechecker reduces the 
challenges when it comes to open communication and awarding credit, as
in-house personnel may be more readily be given access to non-anonymised
submission material and receives a proper salary instead of public credit
as part of the scientific community.

In contrast, for researchers it can be very important to be publicly credited
with their activity as a reviewer (see \nameref{who-knows-who}). A regular
review may be listed in public databases (e.g., ORCID
\footnote{\href{https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006971333-Peer-Review}{https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006971333-Peer-Review}} or commercial offerings such as Publons
\footnote{\href{https://publons.com/}{https://publons.com/}} or 
ReviewerCredits\footnote{\href{https://www.reviewercredits.com/}{https://www.reviewercredits.com/}}).
A codechecker should be listed just the same. The number of scientific reviews
is of course a very coarse indicator for the community contribution by an 
individual, yet is is unclear if a regular reviewer, who in addition
conducts a CODECHECK to the scientific review, should be credited twice.

The codecheckers community\footnote{\href{https://github.com/codecheckers/codecheckers/}{https://github.com/codecheckers/codecheckers/}}
currently has over 20 individuals who signed up as volunteer codecheckers
following talks given on the project in the last 12 months.
That is even though no checks are actively elicited.
We see a high potential in an open shared list of potential codecheckers 
compared to a private, in-house group, as it may better match expertise
and share the workload.
% TODO tell more about the motivations and commitments that we know about?
The overarching community is also a mean to ensure CODECHECK is a viable
option not just for large publishers, independent of their financial model,
but also for independent no-cost open access journals.

\subsubsection*{Who knows who?}\label{who-knows-who}

The topic of blinding is broadly discussed, not the least in the push towards
open peer review as part of the Open Science movement [REF]. Without taking
a strong stand on this discussion, the general motivation for more 
transparency and reproducibility does indeed favour a more open review 
process. However, anonymity can also serve to protect individuals 
\ref{tennant_limitations_2020}, e.g.,  juniour scientists, whereas it might 
be acceptable to require revealing of the names of tenured researchers.
The possible negative effects of a non-anonymous review are greatly reduced
if a CODECHECK is not relevant for the decision to accept or reject, but that
is of course not desirable. Instead, we argue that a CODECHECK is technical
process that should in any case be fixable and not a question of opinion or
faulty approach. It is possible for a nonsense workflow to receive a 
CODECHECK certificate.
Furthermore, the level of documentation that is needed for third parties
to reproduce a workflow is extremely hard to get right. Too often, this 
uncertainty leads to researchers giving up and not documenting at all.

The technical nature of the check and the challenge of good enough 
documentation is why we see great benefits in a effective bidirectional
means of communication between author and codechecker. Instead of trying to
fix problems or guess the next step, the codechecker can ask the author to 
rework the docs  or the code.
Instead of lenghtily describing a small change, the codechecker may simply
provide a fix within the code.
Instead of hiding useful and  instructive files created during the codecheck
(e.g., a machine-readable computing environment specification), the author 
and readers can profit from the software-related expertise of the
codechecker.
While such a communication may be facilitated in an anonymous way by the 
publisher, it most likely only helps to protect the identity of the 
codechecker, because, especially when of a certain size, not trivial, or 
if very specialised, it is close to impossible to fully anonymise a 
software analysis stack.
Therefore, the most effective means with the most desirable result for
the stakeholders is a non-anonymous and collaborative CODECHECK.
The possible contributions by the codechecker may even be integrated into
the code of the workflow and be acknowledged as code commits. This way, 
proper credit is given within the research software development community.
Nevertheless, depending on other needs represented by other dimensions,
the aspect of `Who knows who?' may be the most flexible one.

\subsubsection*{How is the CODECHECK integrated in other processes?}\label{turnaround-time}

As a prerequisite, we see a CODECHECK as part of a typical scholarly
communication process. While more radical ideas to change the paradigms
how researchers share their work exist\footnote{For example Octopus, 
\url{https://science-octopus.org/about}, or Hypergraph
\url{https://www.libscie.org/hypergraph}.}, there is a 
value in an evolutionary approach. Thereby, existing communities can 
transition towards more open practices at their own pace and ensure
no one is left behind unfairly.
When integrating a CODECHECK in existing review and publication processes,
the \emph{turnaround time} is crucial. Depending on when and who conducts
the check, it may be done faster, or add considerably to the overall
time from submission to publication.
In our first checks, we found that a codecheck may generally take from 2-5
hours, with some outliers on the higher end. This time includes writing and
publishing the certificate, but excludes the time for actual computations.
The efforts include considerable time to communicate about the process, 
especially around who publishes what and when, so that proper 
cross-referencing between paper and certificate is ensured.
When integrated into peer review systems, this handling of the steps should
become much more effective.

\section*{Core principles}\label{core-principles}

The example workflow and variations just outlined above reflect our current
views on how a codecheck should be performed. They are not set in
stone, but we do believe the following core principles underpin our
CODECHECK:

\textbf{1. Codecheckers record but don't investigate or fix.} The
codechecker follows the instructions provided by the author in running
the code. If any steps are unclear, or if code does not run correctly,
the codechecker records this fact, and then communicates this
information to the author. We believe that the job of the codechecker is
not to fix all these problems, but simply to report them, and await a
fix from the author.

\textbf{2. Communication between humans is key.} Some code may just work
without any interaction (e.g.~Manuel's certificate TODO add cert number); 
however, more often
there are hidden dependencies that need to be found, or revised software
installations. Allowing the codechecker and human to communicate
directly and openly with each other should make this process as
constructive as possible. We feel that routing this conversation
(possibly anonymously) through a publisher would slow things down and
reduce the chances for community building as well as the lessons learned
for both author and codecheckers.

\textbf{3. Credit is given to codecheckers.} The value of contributing a
CODECHECK is comparable to providing a scientific peer review. Indiviual
variations aside, it may also require a similar amount of time. Therefore,
the codechecker's activity should be publicly recorded and mentioned in the
published paper.
The public record can be realised by publishing the certificate in a 
citable form (i.e., with a DOI; this is done within the community codecheck
process), by listing codecheckers on the journal's website or, ideally, by
publishing the checks alongside peer review activities in public databases.

\textbf{4. Workflows must be auditable.}
This requires that the codechecker 
has at least enough material to validate the workflow outputs submitted by 
the authors. Stark~\cite{stark_before_2018} calls this `preproducibility'
and the ICERM report \cite{} defines the level ``Auditable Research'' 
similarly. Note that openness is not required here, as to accommodate 
communities of practice and review workflows that (currently) do not want
to or are not able to work openly.
A completed check eans that code could be executed at least once without
critical errors or
warnings using the provided instructions, and, therefore, all code and data 
was given and could be investigated more deeply or extended in the future.
Ideally, this is a "one~click" step, but achieving this requires particular 
skills. It is also hard to create a sufficient level of documentation for 
third parties. Furthermore automation may lead to people gaming the system
or reliance on technology hiding important details. All such aspects can
reduce the understandability of the material, which we estimate to be the
best mean to ensure long-term transparency and usefulness.
That is why the possibility to communicate is more important
than perfected workflows, and why a CODECHECK is not automated.
We acknowledge that others have argued in favour of bitwise reproducibility
because in the long run it can be automated\footnote{Konrad Hinsen on 
Twitter: \url{https://twitter.com/khinsen/status/1242842759733665799}};
but until then we need CODECHECK's approach.

\textbf{5. Open by default and transitional by disposition.} % or "design"?
By default, unless there are strong
reasons to the contrary (e.g., clinically-sensitive data), all code and
data, both from author and codechecker, will be made freely available, i.e., 
under open licenses, before or when the certificate is published.
The code and data  publication should follow community good practices.
By disposition, a CODECHECK workflow should be designed as a recognition of
shortcomings in asserting reproducibility of submissions and understand the
complex situation that lead to this. However, establishing a CODECHECK workflow
should go hand in hand with initiatives and a perspective to improve education
around reproducibility of methods and communication of comprehensive 
computational workflows, with the long term goal for a specific community or
journal's target audience to reach a state where the level of verification 
and trust provided by codecheckers becomes part of peer review.

\section*{Implementation}\label{register}

\subsection*{Register}\label{register}
% count certificates: 
% curl https://codecheck.org.uk/register/stats.json
% -1 for Hathway-Goodman (no empty last line, so no -1 for the column headers needed)

We have a curated list of 22 certificates available at
\url{https://codecheck.org.uk/register}. These are a mixture of
reproductions of papers for a variety of reasons and fall into three themes:
(1) `classic' papers from computational neuroscience
(2) COVID-19 modelling preprints, and
(3) GIScience.  
The first theme was the initial set of papers used to explore the concept
of CODECHECK. The idea was to take very well known historical articles from a 
specific domain, in this case the work area of co-author S.~Eglen, possibly 
as as a conversation starter for potential collaborating journals.
The second theme is rather opportunistic. As the COVID-19 pandemic swept
over the whole Earth, we hoped to contribute a small part to science's answer
to the unknown virus. The checks were solicited through community interaction
%Several COVID-19 models have been done during the time of peer review of these papers,
and under our initative rather than requested from journal, but the certificate
has then been acknowledged/cited in the paper (LANCET/LSHTM). % TODO SJE: clarify references in brackets
The third theme represents co-author D.~N\"ust's service as Reproducibility
Reviewer at the AGILE conference series.
Independent of CODECHECK, the \emph{Reproducible AGILE} Initiative \cite{reproducible_agile}
established a process for reproducing workflows at the AGILE conference
series \cite{nust_improving_2020}.
While using slightly different terms and infrastructue, e.g., ``reproducibility
reports'' are published on OSF instead of certificates on Zenodo, the 
reproducibility reviews adhere to the codecheck principles.
Furthermore, a small number of checks was completed as part of a peer reviews
for a GIScience journals.

Table~\ref{tab:register} lists the certificates completed to date,
along with citations to the original papers.
Out of these areas, we would like to briefly highlight three examples here.

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  Gigascience -- our first paper. Only visualisation, not machine
  learning (which would have taken sseveral days of compute time).
\item

  in the popular media at the time, the model was reproducible
  [NOORDEN news piece]. 
\item
  Manuel's certificate -- approached us as he requested a certificate
  as paper was entering peer review.

\subsection*{Annotated certificate}\label{annotated-certificate}

At the completion of each CODECHECK, a certificate is written that
states which outputs, i.e., numbers, figures and tables, from the 
original article could be reproduced by the codechecker.
This certificate is made openly
available so that all readers of the article can see which elements
have been reproduced.  The certificate also includes links to the code
and data used by the codechecker, allowing others to build on the
work.
The format of the certificates has evolved slightly during the
project, as we have learnt to automate different aspects of the
certification.  

To demonstrate the typical contents of a certificate, in
Figure~\ref{fig:cert} we have annotated the first four out of ten
pages of the certificate \texttt{2020-012} \cite{cert-2020-012}.
The referenced article \cite{Unwin2020} describes the modelling COVID-19
across the USA.
%% TODO - has this been published yet?.  No, not yet... in review...
Figure~\ref{fig:cert}A shows the certificate number, and its DOI,
which points to the certificate as archived on Zenodo.
The CODECHECK logo is
attached to the certificate to denote successful reproduction.
Figure~\ref{fig:cert}B provides the key metadata about the check --
which paper was checked, who the authors and the codechecker were,
and when it was checked. Materials
relating to the codecheck are freely available via the Repository
link. This table is generated from machine readable text file, the
CODECHECK configuration file \texttt{codecheck.yml}.
The configuration file collects the core pieces of metadata surrounding
a check and enables current and future automation of workflows and 
meta-analyses.
Figure~\ref{fig:cert}C is a textual summary of how the codecheck was
performed, and any interesting findings.

Figure~\ref{fig:cert}D (page 2 of the certificate) shows a table that
lists the outputs that were generated from the codecheck (this is
termed the MANIFEST).  For each output, there is a comment stating
which figure/table it should be compared to in the original paper,
along with the size of the file.  On page 3 of the certificate,
Figure~\ref{fig:cert}E shows some more detailed notes from the
codechecker, in this case indicating what steps were needed to
initialize the environment and run the code.  This particular example
was quite long, taking about 17 hours to run.  Finally, on page 4 of
the certificate, we see the first output that was generated by the
codecheck (Figure~\ref{fig:cert}F).  In this case, the figure matches
figure~4 of \cite{Unwin2020}.  Subsequent pages of the certificate show other
outputs (not shown here).

\end{figure}

\subsection*{Tools and resources}\label{tools}

To run the system, we rely on freely available infrastructure, more 
specifically GitHub and Zenodo.

The \texttt{codecheckers} GitHub organisation\footnote{
\url{https://github.com/codecheckers}} contains projects managing the
project website, the community of codecheckers, community discussions,
forks of codechecked code repositories, and the main register for
managing the collection of checks. Both the website\footnote{
\url{https://codecheck.org.uk/}} and the register
\footnote{\url{https://codecheck.org.uk/register}} are hosted as GitHub
pages. The register is effectively a single table in CSV format that
connects the certificate identifier with the repository associated with
a specific conducted codecheck. Each of these repositories, which 
currently can be hosted on GitHub or Open Science Framework (OSF), 
contains the CODECHECK metadata file \texttt{codecheck.yml}. The register
further contains a column for the type of check, e.g., community, journal,
or conference, and the respective GitHub issue where communications and 
assignments around a specific check are organised. No information is 
duplicated between the register and the metadata files. When a new
certificate is entered into the register, an automated process using 
continuous integration infrastructure of GitHub, GitHub Actions, retrieves
the metadata files and builds different representations of the register
for viewing (HTML) or integration with other services (CSV, JSON).

Zenodo is an open repository for scientific data and documents. It
mints DOIs for deposits and ensures long-term availability of all digital
artefacts related to the project. These include the community 
certificates as well as the register, which is regularly archived to 
Zenodo \cite{codecheck_register} (including all file formats).

A custom R package, \texttt{codecheck}\footnote{
\url{https://github.com/codecheckers/codecheck}}, helps with the authoring
of certificates, and with the deposition of certificates and reated files to
Zenodo using the R package \texttt{zen4R} \cite{zen4r}.
Codecheckers may choose to not use the package and rely on their own tools
for creating the certificate. This is a deliberate flexibility to
accomodate both different skill sets and unforseen technical advances or
challenges.

These tools and resources demonstrate that a CODECHECK process can be
managed without infrastructure costs on freely available platforms.
The scripted and automated parts should also ensure that more checks can
be conducted in the future, though the management by a paid CODECHECK
editor or further automation, e.g., with a bot, could improve turnaround time.
The remaining costs are the project's domain, which is negligible, and
the human resources for managing the project and processes, which are
considerable and currently soley based on, partly grant-based, public funding.
Naturally, similar set-ups are possible, such as using GitLab/GitLab.com 
and the GitLab CI instead of GitHub and GitHub Actions, or using a different 
data repository for depositing certificates and data.

\section*{Related work}\label{related-work}

The journal \emph{ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software (TOMS)} 
established a "Replicated Computational Results" (RCR) review proces
\cite{heroux_editorial_2015} (using "replicable" with the same meaning 
as CODECHECK uses "reproducible").
The CODECHECK principles were independently developed as we only later 
learned about TOMS RCR, which we judge as fulfilling CODECHECK principles
1 to 4.
This work provides more extensive discussion of the possible variants, 
while TOMS RCR realises one particular workflow for reproducibility 
reviews for one particular journal. \cite{heroux_editorial_2015}
include similar concerns about
selection of reviewers as above. Unlike existing CODECHECK certificates, 
the RCR reports undergo editorial review, but this could very well become
part of CODECHECK workflows at journals.
The publication of the RCR report is seen as a reward for the efforts of
the reproducing person, while the possible conflict of interest of this 
motivation is acknowledged. TOMS also reconises reviewer activity in a 
partnership with Publons
\footnote{\url{https://authors.acm.org/author-services/publons}},
though it is unclear if the author of an RCR report receives both the report
authorship and the reviewer recognition. In any case, this is different
from CODECHECK, which specifically aims at recognition as reviewers.
In our view, this removes the possible conflict of interest while keeping
the public acknowledgement.

Specific to the field of Mathematics, the RCR was also  expected to apply a
review of the software itself if the system it runs on cannot be evaluated by
an independent party.
The TOMS RCR also notes the importance of communication and expects
collaboration between author and RCR reviewers.
The TOMS creators share thoughts around reviewer selection and also put trust
in reviewer judgement over numerical bit-wise perfection.
A key difference is that authors opt-in with an \emph{RCR Review Request} and
the RCR reports, which are very similar to CODECHECK certificates, are
published in the TOMS journal next to the actual papers.

A number of journals or conferences/workshops provide guidelines for ensuring reproducible publications and their verification.
These include, for example, \ldots{}

However, no approach besides CODECHECK spans across journals and is
intentionally designed to be picked up and implemented by many different 
journals or events, and to build a community of codecheckers. CODECHECK shares
this interdisciplinary nature with other community iniatives concered with 
reproducibility awareness, education, and supports, such as ReproHack
\footnote{\url{https://reprohack.github.io/reprohack-hq/}}, Code Copilot
\footnote{\url{https://twitter.com/Code_Copilot}}, or Papers with Code
\footenote{\url{https://paperswithcode.com/about}}.
The latter recently announced a collaborations with the preprint server
\emph{arXiv} on providing data and code supplements for machine learning
manuscripts\footnote{\url{https://medium.com/paperswithcode/papers-with-code-partners-with-arxiv-ecc362883167}} and runs a reproduciblity challenge
\footnote{\url{https://paperswithcode.com/rc2020}}.

The journal \emph{ReScience C} publishes replications,
\url{https://rescience.github.io/faq/};
they do not accept proprietary software and require open source code;
they also required a third party to replicate; they also use Zenodo
to issue DOIs.
The journal \emph{Cortex} has a special article type 
\emph{Verification Reports}, which  actually are about replication of results 
but are very well designed/reasoned \cite{chambers_verification_2020}.
In a similar vein, the CODECHECK certificates
could also be published as a special article type within journals.

For research with very high stakes, where reproduction would be too weak and
post publication replication possibly to late because of policiy impact,
\cite{benjamin-chung_internal_2020} propose \emph{internal replication}.
A workflow that underwent internal
replication would very likely be of high quality and relatively easy to codecheck.
In a similar vein, internal codechecks may be used, with the same limitations such
as group think \cite{benjamin-chung_internal_2020},
to ensure reproducibility before submission. The guidelines
for CODECHECK can be used by fellow/not independent lab members just as well.

Gavis and Donoho \cite{gavish_universal_2011} propose a new discipline and 
infrastructure for reproducible computational research with its own tools and
API. Their specific packaging format, provenance record, and cryptographic
\emph{Verifiable Result Identifier} would indeed provide excellent
reproduciblity. However, the system is also complex and was not taken up by
any publisher as far as we know; the system is indeed not open source itself.
In comparison, CODECHECK is less powerful but also much more flexible and
less dependent on specific tools or infrastructure. If data and code are 
deposited properly, i.e., very unlike to disappear, then the certificate's 
DOI is practically quite close to the cryptographic identifier.

Local reproduction initiatives/services:

\href{https://github.com/OxfordCodeReviewNet/forum}{Oxford code review network (OxCRN)}
(community, broader scope).
For these, the CODECHECK scope, tools, and practical experiences may be
helpful resources.

\emph{SciGen.Report} is a community-run platform to foster communication on
reproducibility\footnote{\url{https://scigen.report/}}. People can report on
fully, particially or un-successful reproductions post publication.

\section*{Limitations}\label{limitations}

\textbf{Just peer review}: wait, isn't CODECHECK what peer review should be 
doing already? That is correct.
However, the general observation is that the increasing
number of researchers, submissions, and reviews to conduct under the
pressure to publish, puts the scholarly publication system under a lot
of strain [REF].  We also see parallels to the terms 
`reproducible research' and `open science'. Establishing a CODECHECK 
process is largely an acknowledgement that peer reviewing practices 
have faltered to adapt to the challenges of digitisation and computer-based
research or data science. The concept of a CODECHECK, just as the 
reproducibility of research and the openness of science, may be of 
transitional nature. If the activites described here as being part of a 
CODECHECK become the norm for scientific reviews and publications, then
the initiative will have succeeded.
However, the rapidly changing technology used in research leads us to 
believe that a seperate role of codechecker and the expertise it brings
will be benefitial in the long term.

\textbf{Not going deep enough/too vague}:
CODECHECK by design does not require authors to provide (and sustain) an
eternally functional worklow and neither suggests a specific software stack
or pracitcal approaches, such as research compendia
\footnote{\url{https://research-compendium.science/}},
even if they are very valuable.
Creating something that anyone can reproduce has been called a 
fool's errand
\footnote{\url{https://twitter.com/DougBlank/status/1135904909663068165?s=09}}
and we tend to agree.
However, the package of data, code, and documentation
collaboratively created by authors and codecheckers is a snapshot of a 
working analysis that greatly increases the likelyhood of a successful 
reproduction and possibility to extensions by third parties, with access
to suitable resources and matching skill set, in the future.
Concrete implementations of CODECHECK workflows, especially for specific
disciplines, may reify much more helpful guidelines for authors how to
create reproducibility packages.
The author-friendly ``low bar'' should not stay low forever, but cultural
change takes time and the encouragement and guidance that CODECHECK,
as part of the widely accepted peer review concept, can provide may
eventually allow to raise the bar as high as possible, e.g., with
executable research compendia \cite{nust_opening_2017}
or continuous analysis \cite{beaulieu-jones_reproducibility_2017-1}.
However, considering that missing artefacts and lack of documentation
have repeatedly been identified as main barriers to reproducibility
(e.g., \cite{stagge_assessing_2019,nust_improving_2020}),
we would not underestimate the power of a simple check.

It should be noted that a codechecker is not taking the same roles as the
\emph{statistical reviewer}, as it is practices by some journals in the 
biomedical domain (cf.~\cite{petrovecki_role_2009,greenwood_how_2015}).
The statistical reviewer actually evaluates the appropriateness of
statistical methods \cite{greenwood_how_2015} and can support topical
reviewers if, e.g., complex methods or sophisticated variants of statistical
tests are applied \cite{petrovecki_role_2009}.
The codechecker may go equally deep into the review, if they have, by 
intention of by chance, the required expertise and the required time, 
but they are by no means expected to be able to provide
such a level of scrutiny. We can imagine a tiered workflow where the 
codechecker, just as the conventional reviewer, could recommend a detailed
statistical review to the editor as they might come across upon different
hints.
%The CODECHECK provides a certain level of safety with regard to the inherent
%problems that a computational workflow might have. We want to capture the
%obvious errors, but ... https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-safety-and-security

An important distinction is that a codechecker does not conduct a 
\emph{code review}. Code reviews are without doubt extremely valuable in 
terms of improving reproducibility and re-usability, and their proponents 
even believe they can improve the science \cite{petre_code_2014}.
Code reviews, however, have quite different structural challenges and 
require even more resources. That said, a well-reviewed codebase is likely
to be easier to codecheck, and the awareness for high-quality code raised
through CODECHECK may lead to more support for code reviewing.
Initiatives and journals that conduct software reviews independently of 
a specific publication or workfloware, e.g.,
ROpenSci\footnote{\url{https://ropensci.org/}},
PyOpenSci\footnote{\url{https://www.pyopensci.org/}},
and JOSS\footnote{\url{https://joss.theoj.org/}}.

Furthermore, the codechecker's task list is intentionally not overloaded
with related concerns, even though they are very important, such as ensuring
proper citation of data and software, or depositing data and software in 
suitablerepositories.
We do expect codecheckers to be aware of these though and possibly point 
them out.

\textbf{Handling failure}: we have no established process for the case
that a reproduction fails. This may be the sign of a pre-selection bias
of the examples, as so far all our codechecks succeeded.
In case of a journal adopting CODECHECK for all submissions, the open 
question remains as what to do in this case will have to be answered.
At the start, we doubt publicly reporting failures (i.e., the code 
would not run) will increase overall reproducibility and recommend not
to share the outcome publicly but to share the latest draft of the 
certific with the authors.
One must be careful as to the impact of acceptance by authors and the
concerns of volunteers this approach, or a contrary one, has.
Private feedback for failures and public acknowledgement/encouragement
for successes seems to be the way to go.
\cite{Rosenthal2016b} discuss incentives for different actors around the
implementation of reproducibility. We see CODECHECK as one mean for
organisations to invest in reproducibility by creating incentives
until reproducible computations become the norm.

\textbf{Compute time}: for those papers that take significant compute
time (think days, not minutes), who will pay for the compute time?
The openness of CODECHECK certificates could help to establish community
peer pressure, as submitting authors can be evaluated on their engagement
as codecheckers.
The challegnes of computational resources can also quickly be reduced when
authors provide a small sample or a synthetic dataset together with the
expected outputs for said subset, which can equally wel demonstrate the 
usefulness and validity of their workflow.

\textbf{Proprietary software}: authors can currently provide code that requires
proprietary software. Given the prevalence of proprietary software in
some disciplines, such as MATLAB or eCognition,
this seems like a pragmatic choice.
However, it prohibits to benefit from open infrastructure for reproducibility
(cf.~\cite{konkol_publishing_2020,perkel_make_2019})
and requires the codechecker to have access to that software.
Non-open software also considerably hampers reuse, especially by researchers
from the global south. Therefore, allowing proprietary software is a compromise
that each implementation of CODECHECK should critically reconsider.

\textbf{Not possible for my data}: 
Solutions for proprietary and sensitive data exists.
Authors can provide synthetic data (cf. \cite{shannon_opening_2018}), some
data can effectively be redacted \cite{oloughlin_data_2015}, and publishers or
independent entities can provide infrastructure for sharing data and workflows
confidentially \cite{perignon_certify_2019} or with access to derived results
but not raw data \cite{shannon_opening_2018},
i.e., data enclaves \cite{foster_research_2018},
or domains of reproducibility \cite{harris_more_2017})

\textbf{Can't someone cheat?} Yes. We don't check it is correct code,
just simply that it runs. This `mechanical' test is indeed a very low bar.
Yet, by having the code and (raw) data openly deposited, interested parties can
then examine the code, and knowing that the code will be open we hope will
be an incentive for authors to share. It will also give the opportunity 
to future researchers, potentially with new methods, to look for errors.
This is a much more effective means to avoid cheating than an arms race
trying to catch the cheater with closed datasets and code. This approach
is comparable to the storing of blood samples in sports to detect
doping in the future (cf. \cite{everythinghertz97}).
Another picture that helped us to define the scope of a CODECHECK is:
the codechecker is the forensic photographer, making sure all the details
are captured so that an investigator may, now or in the future, scrutinize
them.

\textbf{Who's got time for more peer review?} Agree.
However, there are differences to peer review.
First, the technical nature of a CODECHECK can provide a more 
clearly defined scope and expectations compared to conventional 
peer review. The authors are told what to provide and the codechecker
can be told when to stop, for example.
Second, the specific skill set allows to introduce different groups
into the peer review process. ECRs might be attracted to working with
groups to learn more about recent methods and reproducibility practices.
Research software experts (Research Software Engineers, RSE) who might
not regularly be involved in writing or reviewing papers could be 
interested to increase their connection with scholarly practices.
An extra codechecker may simplify the matchmaking an editor has to do
when identifying suitable reviewers for a submission, as technical and
topical expertise can be provided by different people, who must not even
be traditional peer reviewers. In fact, the codechecker could even be
a software professional employed by a publisher.
Third, recall that we expect CODECHECKSs to be not anonymous and always
publicly deposited, which is common practice for some journals, but not
broadly practiced. The possibility to ask for clarification or more 
material/information can greatly reduce the digging required and thereby
the time spend.
We also found that the focus on the mechanics of a
workflow and the ability to interact with the authors can make
reproductions very educational. It's a different role and as such could
be a welcome alternation/diversion for researchers to give back their 
time to the community.

\textbf{Who finds the codechecker?} Good point! The journal, using either
their own team of codecheckers or the public database. Community
however think this is an important issue, and are volunteering.
With increasing demand 

\textbf{Checking multiple times?} If you check a preprint before peer
review or a submission to a journal with non-public review,
it might need checking again as it is modified during peer
review.  This is in part unavoidable, and as happened to us (e.g., 
`2020-012` has been revised). This can also be desired, if the
interaction between author, reviewer, and codechecker lead to
improvements.
Since checking the manuscript the second time is likely to be
much less work than the first time, this is largely mitigated by 
open and regular communication.
The higher the reproducibility and automation, the more aspects of 
a CODECHECK may eventually be supported by automation, though we believe
the human codecheckers should remain the decision maker.
Automatically detecting if results are ``the same'' is a question
intrinsically linked with each unique process and quite hard to realise
for common outputs, such as plots or maps.
Nevertheless, continuous integration (CI) infrastructure may help 
codecheckers, and, without much further work, use scientific workflows as
detectors for when a piece of software breaks if a workflow is set up to
use the latest versions of tools.

As a principle, we do not require results to be exactly the same for a
codecheck to pass, simply that the code runs and generates the output
files that the author claims. Stochastic simulations mean that often
we cannot get exactly the same, or even different versions of
libraries.  (Cite freesurfer example \cite{Gronenschild2012-pp} that
generates different outputs on different operating systems).

\begin{itemize}
\item modelDB principle: minimum of one figure should be reproducibe.
  Example certificate 2020-016 (I think) which had only a small subset
  of the possible figures. Still useful and worth sharing.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Not revolutionary enough?}
CODECHECK's approach is to acknowledge the shortcomings around 
computational reproducibility and iteratively improve within the current
system of scholarly communication through journals.
It remains to be proved if this approach is welcomed broadly and if 
involving the traditional system of publishers helps to push the 
conversation along or not.
We have discussed stronger more drastic rules at length, such as only 
considering diamond Open Access journals, community-led no-fee journals,
or journals with collaborative/open peer review, but eventually decided
against it.
Note that the focused nature of the CODECHECK principles allows journals
and publishers to innovate on the finance model and peer review practices
at their own pace.

\section*{Conclusions and future work}\label{future-work-and-conclusions}

CODECHECK works!
We have created a considerable number of certificates to demonstrate it.
The creation of the certificates and the interactions with authors and
editors not only improved the principles and the workflow, but also
confirmed the approach taken. This result corroborates findings from
similar evaluations of reproducible computational research in journals and
at conferences.
CODECHECKs and can increase trust in scientific results and the set of 
shared principles and name can through recognition value allow researchers
across publication venues to judge the level of scrutiny that results have
faced. CODECHECK requires direct acknowledgement of the contribution to the
scientific community in the role, not indirectly via citations of 
reproductions, and can be a worthwhile educational activity, especially for
ECRs. A technically simple yet far reaching change would be a special type of 
reviewer activity for codechecking in public researcher profiles next to
conventional peer reviews.

Yet, CODECHECK underlies the same limitations as peer review
in general and is closely connected to larger disruptions and challenges
in scholarly communication
\cite{eglen_recent_2018,tennant_ten_2019,fyfe_mission_2019}, 
including the tensions between commercial publishing and reviewer's often
free labour, and a global pandemic jumbling up scientific publishing
and exposing a broader general audience to science, even preliminary 
results \cite{munafo_what_2020}.
Even more, it is clear that establishing CODECHECK-like systems can be 
impeded by and must be seen in connection to much larger issues in 
science, such as broken metrics or malpractices triggered by publication
pressure \cite{piwowar_altmetrics:_2013,nosek_promoting_2015}.
We certainly do not want the binary attribute of "CODECHECK completed"
to become a factor in bibliometric approaches for performance assesments.

While developed for the current "paper"-centric publication process and
being compatible with different styles of peer review, the CODECHECK 
principles would also work well with novel publication paradigms, e.g.,
peer-reviewed computational notebooks \cite{earthcube_new_2020},
iterative and granular communication of scientific outputs,
such as Octopus\footnote{\url{https://science-octopus.org/}}, 
articles with live-code \cite{perkel_pioneering_2019-1}
\footnote{For example, eLife's ERA, see 
\url{https://elifesciences.org/labs/dc5acbde/welcome-to-a-new-era-of-reproducible-publishing}.},
decentralized infrastructure and public reviewer reputation systems
\cite{tenorio-fornes_towards_2019},
and completely new visions for scholarly communication and peer review
\footnote{Cf., for example, \emph{A modern vision for peer review} by 
Amy J. Ko: \url{https://medium.com/bits-and-behavior/a-modern-vision-for-peer-review-d5f73f0fae07}}.
An explicit segmentation of research steps could even make the focus 
of a CODECHECK easier by only checking the ``analysis'' sub-publication.
The discovery of CODECHECKs could be increased by depositing the reports
into public databases of reproductions, such as \emph{SciGen.Report}.
Public researcher profiles, such as ORCID, may consider different
types of reviewer activity to capture the contributions of independent 
code execution to science.
Notably, the discussed limitations are largely self-imposed for easier
acceptance and evolutionary integration, as to not break the current 
system and increase demands over time without leaving practitioners behind. 

If adopted today, a CODECHECK system, even if temporal in a sustainable 
transition towards more open publication and review practices, can contribute
to increased trust in the results of research. Introducing CODECHECK
should be informed by lessons learned from (introducing) open peer review
(OPR) \cite{ross-hellauer_guidelines_2019}.
All our conversations with publishers and editors at some point
touched on the procedural and technical implications of openness, be it 
that OPR is neither applied nor well-known by stakeholders, or that process
management software would not support such open communication.
We would be keen to use the flexibility of the principles and cooperate
on non-public CODECHECKs to learn more about the advantages and yet unclear
specific challenges. Does CODECHECK work better with OPR?
Each rollout of CODECHECK should be accompanied by studies to ensure 
codechecking does not fall into the same gaps as peer review did \cite{tennant_limitations_2020}
and to ensure positive change within the respective peer review system.
More reproducible practices initiated by CODECHECKs could lead
communities/disciplines to reach a state where authors do provide good
enough material and reviewers have acquired broady enough skills that
the latter will generally conduct a CODECHECK-level of checking, and
only in especially sophisticated cases will a specialised codechecker
be included.
The main challenge for us remains to get journals to embrace the
idea behind CODECHECK and realise processes conform to the principles,
whether they use the actual name for it or not.
The CODECHECK badge is, intentionally, not branded and simply states
``code works''.
This \emph{cultural change}, however, is needed for the valuation of the
efforts that go into proper evaluation of papers.
Multiple adopting journals will also help to answer relevant questions on
the establishing process (What are crucial decisions or pain points? Can
authors retract code/data once a CODECHECK has started?),
what variants of CODECHECKs will be most common, and how open CODECHECKs
may influence the scope and anonymity of conventional review over time.

With the implementation of CODECHECK workflows, the question of training
codecheckers will become relevant. We expect both a mentoring scheme within
the CODECHECK community (experienced codecheckers provide on the job training
or serve as fallback advisors) as well as collaboration with reproducible
research initiatives such as
ReproHack\footnote{\url{https://reprohack.github.io/reprohack-hq/}},
ReproducibiliTea\footnote{\url{https://reproducibilitea.org/}}
\cite{fitzgibbon_brewing_2020},
and Repro4Everyone\footnote{\url{https://repro4everyone.org/}}
\cite{auer_reproducibility_2020},
to be able to grow the pool of codecheckers as needed.
The initial reaction of the scientific community, where up to today over 
twenty people spontaneously signed up as volunteer codecheckers after talks
on the initiative, makes us feel optimistic that the time is right for 
putting scholarly peer review on the path to facilitate sharing and execution
of computer programs and documenting reproducibility of results.
