# Background

- role of data and code, data science
- reproducible resarch
- data enclaves
- CASCAID
- ROpenSci/PyOpenSci

**main contributions**

- a concept for integrating a minimal code review into common scholarly communication processes around peer review
- set of shared principles (recognition value) that allow researchers to quickly understand the level of evaluation across journals/publishers/conferences, and allows helps these stakeholders to establish workflow checking in their domain/solution/product
- a common language and rubric for classifying different levels of code and data evaluation as part of a peer-review

# What is CODE CHECK?

- **Principles**: https://codecheck.org.uk/
- relation to "proper" citation of data and software, and depositing of data and software in suitable repos _besides_ the bundle for CODE CHECK: do it, only provide the concrete analysis script for the check
- **Why is it useful?**
  - reduce the barrier to evaluating non-text parts of research
  - acknowledges different skill sets and existing high load on reviewers
  - CC breaks problem that publishers staff expertise today is not likely to suffice
  - engaging ECRs is a perfet fit (they are up-to-date in methods, are introduced to peer review)
  - relation to research compendia? point it out for authors unsure about how to structure their workflow
  - CrossRef and Publons and ORCID have features around reviews
  - shifting burden from reviewer to author (but not too much)

# CODE CHECK implementation concepts

- need to get wording straight: process/implementation/workflow (DN: suggest to use "workflow" for research-analysis workflow)
- https://codecheck.org.uk/process/
- _dimensions_ along which a check can vary
- independent/pre-submission (Peer_Coding) by author + colleagues
- AGILE
- premier (OA) publisher
- community OA / scholarly society with public peer review
- invited reproducibility paper track, cf. https://www.elsevier.com/journals/information-systems/0306-4379/guide-for-authors

# Annotated Examples
<!-- see examples.md -->

- **the default implementation**
- critically discuss our/the default implementation vs. the principles
- HPC example

# Open problems

- need publishers build up data science experts who can conduct checks?
- integration of software/data citation checks benefitial?
- bot-support and tools (linter)
- Does nudging towards better practices work (highlight the successes) or is any check with opt-in doomed to fail?
