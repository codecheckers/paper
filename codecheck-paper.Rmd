# Background

- role of data and code, data science
- reproducible resarch
- data enclaves
- CASCAID
- ROpenSci/PyOpenSci (and how their software review differs, though they also collaborate with journals, https://devguide.ropensci.org/softwarereviewintro.html)
- time capsules > https://twitter.com/DougBlank/status/1135904909663068165?s=09
- science is changing: https://theconversation.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-how-coronavirus-is-changing-science-137641
- reproducibility is important, also
  - effects on well-being/mental health, https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01642-9

**main contributions**

- a concept for integrating a minimal code review into common scholarly communication processes around peer review
- set of shared principles (recognition value) that allow researchers to quickly understand the level of evaluation across journals/publishers/conferences, and allows helps these stakeholders to establish workflow checking in their domain/solution/product
- a common language and rubric for classifying different levels of code and data evaluation as part of a peer-review

# What is CODE CHECK?

- **Principles**: https://codecheck.org.uk/
- relation to "proper" citation of data and software, and depositing of data and software in suitable repos _besides_ the bundle for CODE CHECK: do it, only provide the concrete analysis script for the check
- **Why is it useful?**
  - reduce the barrier to evaluating non-text parts of research
  - acknowledges different skill sets and existing high load on reviewers
  - CC breaks problem that publishers staff expertise today is not likely to suffice
  - engaging ECRs is a perfet fit (they are up-to-date in methods, are introduced to peer review)
  - relation to research compendia? point it out for authors unsure about how to structure their workflow
  - CrossRef and Publons and ORCID have features around reviews
  - shifting burden from reviewer to author (but not too much)
  - What issues with (open) peer review does CODECHECK address?
- keynote https://doi.org/10.7557/5.4963: in discussion, the speaker mentioned value of peer review for "baseline reassurance", i.e. a paper has at least been checked by someone with an understanding, to increase trust especially if looking at papers from other disciplines
- **report** must fulfil some requirements to make clear what is really checked and not mislead - readers will have very different understandings of a green checkmark!
- reproducibility is hard https://twitter.com/annakrystalli/status/1144176149859377152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw > code check gives at least some benefits
- what are the requirements / level or reproducibility required or checked?
  - [Stodden et al., 2013](https://stodden.net/icerm_report.pdf): five-level hierarchy of research - reviewable, replicable, confirmable, auditable, and open or reproducible
  - [Whitaker 2017](https://figshare.com/articles/Showing_your_working_A_guide_to_reproducible_neuroimaging_analyses/4244996/2): reproducible, generalisable, replicability, robustnes
- can authors retract their code/data once a CODECHECK has started? In the eLife prepreint review, there seems no "way back", see https://twitter.com/ceptional/status/1271528976763121664?s=09

# CODE CHECK implementation concepts

- need to get wording straight: process/implementation/workflow (DN: suggest to use "workflow" for research-analysis workflow)
- https://codecheck.org.uk/process/
- _dimensions_ along which a check can vary
- independent/pre-submission (Peer_Coding) by author + colleagues
- AGILE
- premier (OA) publisher
- community OA / scholarly society with public peer review
- invited reproducibility paper track, cf. https://www.elsevier.com/journals/information-systems/0306-4379/guide-for-authors
- on giving credit: public databases
  - https://www.reviewercredits.com/
  - Publons
  - ORCID
- compare with existing processes that are publicly documented
  - AJPS Verification Policy: https://ajps.org/ajps-verification-policy/
  - ...
- flexible level of detail? a check can be enhanced to (potentially semi-automatically) check for good practices
  - "A group of us in the @force11rescomm Software Citation Implementation Working Group produced a "Software Citation Checklist for Authors" https://t.co/4Noe66FsoX providing guidelines on how to cite software and describing why it is important and what software should be cited" via https://twitter.com/alegonbel/status/1207664922932453376?s=09)
- focus on ECR as codecheckers
  - ECR are the one's breaking new ground in schol comm, cf. the percentages of career stages submitting registered reports on slide 20 > https://osf.io/2vjus/ 

# Annotated Examples
<!-- see examples.md -->

- **the default implementation**
- critically discuss our/the default implementation vs. the principles
- HPC example
- if we see the corpus of examles as a scientific dataset, it should be published in a citable way (maybe even submit to a data journal)

# Open problems

- Do publishers need to build up data science experts who can conduct checks?
- Is an integration of software/data citation checks benefitial/realistic?
- Bot-support and tools (linter, report authoring with R Markdown)
- How can open platforms be used to enable a review in private (cf. https://www.cambridge.org/core/blog/2019/08/19/how-to-make-the-data-and-code-for-your-manuscript-available-to-peer-reviewers-before-making-it-public/), if that is desired
- Does nudging towards better practices work (highlight the successes) or is any check with opt-in doomed to fail?
- Do we need more than one codechecker? Is there a similar diversity as in a peer review where more opinions are needed?
- can CODECHECK work for preprints? how? is a re-check required?
- Risk: is the hurdle too low? are "levels" of checks are solution to increase transparency of check's level of detail
- CODECHECK in the context of innovations and disruptions in scientific publishing
  - https://doi.org/10.1042/ETLS20180172
  - https://doi.org/10.3390/publications7020034
- Should every code be checkd, or should the labour be capped by only checking "important" works or at important stages; if yes, isn't peer review such a stage?
- see https://github.com/codecheckers/discussion
- Can we establish code checks as a type of review within the schol comm metadata (or should we?) > we should not, put them on the same level as reviews!
- How can we turn a CODECHECK into a positive experience?
  - cf. kindness in peer review in https://www.mdpi.com/2304-6775/8/2/26
- How can we allow reactions to checks? (commenting on reports)
- Will bitwise reproducibility become easier than what a CODECHECK does? triggered by https://twitter.com/khinsen/status/1242842759733665799?s=09)
- If a report is not published for failures: Isn't there a bias for the codechecker to have a "successful" reproduction because then a report is published?
