# Background

- role of data and code, data science
- reproducible resarch
- data enclaves
- CASCAID
- ROpenSci/PyOpenSci
- time capsules > https://twitter.com/DougBlank/status/1135904909663068165?s=09

**main contributions**

- a concept for integrating a minimal code review into common scholarly communication processes around peer review
- set of shared principles (recognition value) that allow researchers to quickly understand the level of evaluation across journals/publishers/conferences, and allows helps these stakeholders to establish workflow checking in their domain/solution/product
- a common language and rubric for classifying different levels of code and data evaluation as part of a peer-review

# What is CODE CHECK?

- **Principles**: https://codecheck.org.uk/
- relation to "proper" citation of data and software, and depositing of data and software in suitable repos _besides_ the bundle for CODE CHECK: do it, only provide the concrete analysis script for the check
- **Why is it useful?**
  - reduce the barrier to evaluating non-text parts of research
  - acknowledges different skill sets and existing high load on reviewers
  - CC breaks problem that publishers staff expertise today is not likely to suffice
  - engaging ECRs is a perfet fit (they are up-to-date in methods, are introduced to peer review)
  - relation to research compendia? point it out for authors unsure about how to structure their workflow
  - CrossRef and Publons and ORCID have features around reviews
  - shifting burden from reviewer to author (but not too much)
- keynote https://doi.org/10.7557/5.4963: in discussion, the speaker mentioned value of peer review for "baseline reassurance", i.e. a paper has at least been checked by someone with an understanding, to increase trust especially if looking at papers from other disciplines
- **report** must fulfil some requirements to make clear what is really checked and not mislead - readers will have very different understandings of a green checkmark!

# CODE CHECK implementation concepts

- need to get wording straight: process/implementation/workflow (DN: suggest to use "workflow" for research-analysis workflow)
- https://codecheck.org.uk/process/
- _dimensions_ along which a check can vary
- independent/pre-submission (Peer_Coding) by author + colleagues
- AGILE
- premier (OA) publisher
- community OA / scholarly society with public peer review
- invited reproducibility paper track, cf. https://www.elsevier.com/journals/information-systems/0306-4379/guide-for-authors
- on giving credit: public databases
  - https://www.reviewercredits.com/
  - Publons
  - ORCID
- compare with existing processes that are publicly documented
  - AJPS Verification Policy: https://ajps.org/ajps-verification-policy/
  - ...
- flexible level of detail? a check can be enhanced to (potentially semi-automatically) check for good practices
  - "A group of us in the @force11rescomm Software Citation Implementation Working Group produced a "Software Citation Checklist for Authors" https://t.co/4Noe66FsoX providing guidelines on how to cite software and describing why it is important and what software should be cited" via https://twitter.com/alegonbel/status/1207664922932453376?s=09)

# Annotated Examples
<!-- see examples.md -->

- **the default implementation**
- critically discuss our/the default implementation vs. the principles
- HPC example
- if we see the corpus of examles as a scientific dataset, it should be published in a citable way (maybe even submit to a data journal)

# Open problems

- need publishers build up data science experts who can conduct checks?
- integration of software/data citation checks benefitial?
- bot-support and tools (linter)
- Does nudging towards better practices work (highlight the successes) or is any check with opt-in doomed to fail?
- Do we need more than one codechecker? Is there a similar diversity as in a peer review where more opinions are needed?
- can CODE CHECK work for preprints? how? is a re-check required?
- risk: is the hurdle too low? are "levels" of checks are solution to increase transparency of check's level of detail
- code check in the context of innovations and disruptions in scientific publishing
