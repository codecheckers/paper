CODECHECK: An open-science initiative for the independent execution of computations underlying research articles

@nordholmen and @StephenEglen present ideas and first results of #CODECHECK. ðŸ§µ

------

A core problem of scholarly communication today is that papers are not sufficient to share research if computations are used. PDFs prohibit reuse, transparency, and collaboration. But authors don't have incentives to share all material.

------

Policies are getting stricter, but sharing alone does not ensure that the basic mechanics of computational workflows actually work. This is what codecheckers can ensure as part of the peer review process.

We have discussed the possible variants of executing analyses as part of reviews with several stakeholders. There are many options! Thanks go to

Based on these discussions we defined the 5 PRINCIPLES OF CODECHECK.
1. Record but don't fix
2. Communication is key
3. Give credit
4. Auditable workflows
5. Open and transitional

------

We conducted 25 CODECHECKs and wrote just as much CODECHECK certificates to evaluate and demonstrate the idea. Thanks to all editors and authors who have contributed to these prototypes! See the full register at https://codecheck.org.uk/register/

We welcome feedback from #OpenScience #ReproducibleResearch communities!
We are aware of many limitations. We would love to leverage more infrastructure and awesome tools, but for now: a CODECHECK means 1 researcher was able to execute a workflow without critical errors and get the same outputs as advertised once. #BabySteps

------

We want to grow CODECHECK!

We look for journals & editors who want to establish CODECHECK processes as part of their review and publication policies. We want to share our experiences with you!
We also look for codecheckers!

We started signing up volunteers who would conduct CODECHECKs. Executing someone else's workflow can be very educational and is a great contribution to ensure the transparency and understandability of research results.

It's time to change scientific publishing. Let's evaluate and value data and software published together papers at lleast at a minimum level. Let's learn, improve, increase requirements, and eventually normalise code execution during peer review.
